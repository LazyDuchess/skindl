Bomb Rush Cyberfunk GameBanana downloader. Hijacks the Concursus URI scheme.

## Why?

I don't like Concursus. Also, I need a small programming project to get used to a split keyboard.

## How to use

- Get the executable (TODO: download links)
- Launch the executable and select your CrewBoom folder
- Click "Concursus Mod Manager" when downloading a file
- Profit (hopefully)

## TODO

- [x] Registering the URI handler
- [x] Downloading mods
  - [x] zip
  - [x] cbb
  - [x] 7z
  - [x] rar
- [ ] Better error handling & idiot proofing
  - [ ] Show errors instead of insta closing
  - [ ] Ensure selected folder is valid on select
  - [ ] Move game path file to somewhere harder to accidentally delete
- [ ] GUI with eframe
- [ ] GitHub Actions/Releases
